This is the first Tableau project I did for my PORTFOLIO, where I build dashboard using the netflix movies & tv shows dataset.

* Data was taken from the netflix tittles dataset.
* The Dataset : [Netflix_titles.csv](https://github.com/chiragbaswala/MY_PORTFOLIO_PROJECTS/blob/4cd463db6bb1ab1a1511fdab5b1cdca0ad6a7a32/netflix_titles.csv)
* A portion of Netflix_titles dataset was used while building the project.
* This is how my dashboard looks like:
